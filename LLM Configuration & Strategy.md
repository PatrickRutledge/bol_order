# ðŸ§  Language Model (LLM) Configuration & Strategy

This section outlines the LLM architecture, persona injection patterns, and prompt strategies used (or planned) to drive agent intelligence in the Loading Dock Control Panel system.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Model Selection

The system is designed to be model-flexible. Primary targets for deployment:

- **OpenAI GPT-4-turbo**
- **Azure OpenAI variants**
- **Granite 3.1 (IBM)** â€” Currently under evaluation
- **Anthropic Claude (future compatibility)**

LLM configuration is loaded via `llm_config` blocks in agent templates or `config.json`.
