# ðŸ“„ Manifest Agent

"""
The ManifestAgent is responsible for transforming raw BOL (Bill of Lading) inputs into structured CSV manifest records.
It is the backbone of the Loading Dock Control Panelâ€™s agent loopâ€”handling data parsing, validation, and archival handoff.
"""

# ðŸ§  Agent Profile

"""
- Name: manifest_agent
- Role: Structured document generator
- Persona: Disciplined, detail-oriented, and audit-conscious
- Model: (TBD per system config) â€” OpenAI / Azure / Granite 3.1 compatible
- LLM Config:
    - Temperature: 0.2
    - Max tokens: 1024
    - System prompt: 
        "You are a data transformation agent that receives semi-structured text 
         and emits a clean CSV row with canonical formatting and units. 
         Be strict about missing values, and always preserve original field labels as metadata."
"""

# ðŸ“¥ Inputs

"""
- Triggered by WatcherAgent upon valid file drop
- Accepts JSON payloads or semi-structured BOL blocks
- Example payload:
"""

# {
#   "shipment_id": "BOL_2025_0071",
#   "origin": "Chicago DC",
#   "destination": "Birmingham Dock A",
#   "pallets": 12,
#   "carrier": "Unified Freight Lines",
#   "weight_lbs": 14400,
#   "timestamp": "2025-06-30T18:45:21Z"
# }

# ðŸ“¤ Output

"""
Emits one or more rows to: /Generated/manifests/manifest_YYYYMMDD.csv

Sample:
"""

# shipment_id,origin,destination,pallets,carrier,weight_lbs,timestamp
# BOL_2025_0071,Chicago DC,Birmingham Dock A,12,Unified Freight Lines,14400,2025-06-30T18:45:21Z

"""
Optional:
- JSON mirror file in /Generated/json/
- Log append with timestamp, agent UUID, and BOL filename
"""

# ðŸ”— Connected Agents

"""
- WatcherAgent â†’ triggers ManifestAgent on drop
- ValidatorAgent â†’ post-processes manifest for format integrity
- LoggerAgent â†’ archives CSV + JSON + logs
"""

# ðŸ§­ Roadmap & Enhancements

"""
Planned and proposed upgrades for future versions:
"""

# - âœ… Field-level confidence estimation (low-certainty values flagged)
# - âœ… Auto-correction for common formatting/spacing/OCR issues
# - âœ… Alternate input modes: PDF, HTML email parsing
# - âœ… Retry-on-failure: Escalate to fallback parser or LLM agent
# - âœ… Tagging: HOLD / URGENT / DEFERRED routing labels
# - âœ… Output hook for notifying DispatcherAgent

"""
Each feature will be version-tagged and rolled out under Git-tracked milestones.
"""

# ðŸ§ª Testing Scenarios

"""
- Valid structured JSON â†’ produces correct CSV
- Missing field â†’ triggers LLM fallback (e.g. estimate or null flag)
- Invalid date format â†’ correction or rejection logged
- Duplicate shipment â†’ de-duped or archived with suffix
"""

# ðŸ§¬ Design Philosophy

"""
Modular, resilient, and transparentâ€”ManifestAgent transforms logistics into legible data. 
Its output is the foundation of all downstream visibility in the system and must favor traceability over guesswork.
