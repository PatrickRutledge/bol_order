## ðŸ¤– Agent Architecture & AutoGen Studio Integration (Planned)

**AutoGen Studio** is a framework for building multi-agent applications using large language models (LLMs). Instead of a single monolithic assistant, AutoGen lets you create *specialized agents*â€”each with its own role, goals, and communication policy. These agents can message each other, reason independently, and collaborate to solve tasks end-to-end.

### Why AutoGen?

Our current system is implemented via structured scripts and JSON-based config/dispatch logic. However, migrating to AutoGen unlocks more scalable, maintainable multi-agent patterns, such as:

- **Role-based agents** (e.g. WatcherAgent, ManifestBuilder, Dispatcher)
- **Autonomous coordination** via message passing
- **Dynamic task routing** (one agent delegates to another)
- **Prompt modularity** and reusable agent skill sets

### Studio Interface

[AutoGen Studio](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/studio/) is a visual builder for prototyping agent workflows. It allows developers to:

- Define agent personalities, goals, and tool access
- Create multi-step communication flows
- Test agent interactions in a sandboxed loop
- Deploy working prototypes as Python classes or JSON schemas

### Agent Model Anatomy

Each agent typically defines:
- `name`: Unique identifier
- `system_message`: Sets behavior and tone
- `llm_config`: Which model to use + parameters
- `functions/tools`: Optional access to APIs, file systems, external logic
- `is_termination_msg`: Callback to determine when an agent should stop responding

### Planned Integration

We are exploring a transition from JSON-triggered tasks to AutoGen-powered loops with:

- A persistent WatcherAgent that listens for file changes
- A ManifestAgent that evaluates raw BOL files and builds CSVs
- A ReporterAgent that archives, logs, or dispatches metadata
- Optional ValidatorAgent for manifest quality control

Each component will align with our core principles: *traceability, scalability,* and *reasoning transparency*.

> Our ultimate goal is to not just process filesâ€”but to create a resilient digital twin with proactive agency and cross-agent cognition. AutoGen Studio will help structure, test, and evolve that architecture interactively.
